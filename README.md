CS-465 Full Stack Development

Architecture
When developing the frontend of this project, I worked with Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) framework. Express HTML and JavaScript were useful for setting up the basic structure and logic, but using the SPA improved performance by dynamically updating the UI without reloading the page. This approach not only streamlined the user experience but also reduced server requests. On the backend, I chose MongoDB, a NoSQL database, because its schema flexibility and scalability made it ideal for handling unstructured data and quickly adapting to application changes.

Functionality
JSON, unlike JavaScript, is a lightweight data format used for transmitting structured data. It bridges the gap between the frontend and backend by ensuring that data is formatted in a way both sides can interpret seamlessly. During the development process, I refactored code several times, such as modularizing UI components to make them reusable. This improved efficiency and made the application easier to maintain since changes to one component automatically reflected across the app.

Testing
API testing was critical to ensure proper request and retrieval methods. Each endpoint was tested for functionality and security, including login authentication for admin users. Adding security layers brought challenges, but understanding methods and endpoints allowed me to debug and refine the system, ensuring it was both secure and user-friendly.

Reflection
This course has been instrumental in helping me achieve my professional goals. Iâ€™ve gained experience in full stack development, particularly in integrating secure authentication, which is a valuable skill for building reliable web applications. These experiences have not only broadened my technical knowledge but have also made me a stronger candidate in the tech field.
